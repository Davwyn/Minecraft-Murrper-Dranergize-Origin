## Varient Changes
The following alterations from the FutaraDragon race is as follows:

**Initial Experience**

You start with 10 levels of experience, enough to unlock your first ability.

**Starwisps**

Davwyn's Starwisps are less agressive than Futara's Energy Orbs. They do not attack most friendly or passive mobs, or mobs you've applied a name tag to. They will however attack angered mobs. They also come in a range of colours and will briefly light targets on fire.

**Carnivore**

You can only eat meat be it cooked or raw. Raw meat is almost as good as cooked in most cases.

**Digging Claws**

You can dig through soft ores, stone, sand, and dirt with your claws as if you had stone tools with your empty paws.

**Limited Manipulators**

You have paws and a maw which limit your ability to wield weapons. You can't swing swords or use ranged weapons.

**Hunger Usage**

Activities like running, jumping, and special moves that use stamina all affect your hunger.

**Hunger Effect Immune**

You have an resiliant stomach. Poisonous food can't give you the 'Hunger' effect.

**Natural Exhustion**

Beyond using up all of your stamina, running, jumping, and other activities use up your hunger bar. You'll need to eat more often when very active.

**Fall Immune**

Your wings protect you from any fall damage, even if you haven't unlocked flight yet.

**No Horde Party**

Horde Party from FutaraDragon race is removed. No surprise monsters appear.

**Crystal Harvest**

Your starwisp abilities allow you to convert sand into crystal.\nEither put sand on your back (Offhand), Sneak and click the 'Place' button while looking into empty space, or have someone else 'Sneak' while they 'Place' sand on you to in the order of likelihood harvest glass, tinted glass, amethyst, or quartz at random.

**Starwisp Dust**

Your scales are covered in soft glowing starwisp dust which can be collected.\nEither put an empty bottle on your back (Offhand), Sneak and click the 'Place' button while looking into empty space, or have someone else 'Sneak' while they 'Use' an empty bottle on you to harvest this dust into the bottle. The dust when used grants temporary night-vision by making user glow.

**Low-Light Vision**

In darkness your eyes will adjust giving you full night-vision. This farther expands on FutaraDragon Energy Eyes.

**Glowing**

Because of the starwisp dust on your scales you always give off a soft light.

**Slightly shorter**

You're slightly smaller than a human.\n(Requires Pehkui mod).

**Plasma Beam**

Davwyn's Plasma Beam is essentially identical to Futara's Hyper-Beam other than the sound it makes.

**Plasma Blast**

Davwyn's powers are plasma-based. Futara's Plasma Blast is renamed to Plasma Blast.

**Plasma Bolt**

Davwyn's powers are plasma-based. Futara's Energy Shot is renamed to Plasma Bolt.

**Murrper**

Your dragon species doesn't rawr, you 'Murrp'.

# Change Log

## Version 3.4.1

- Merged in Futara Dragon Origin updates for 1.4 and 1.5

- Worked with Futara Dragon to impliment the 'Dragon Tacking' feature, allowing players to add or remove items from you if you allow it in the extra options menu.

- Reworked 'Harvest Crystal' power to be more lore-accurate and fun to use. Now either yourself or others can place sand on your back (off-hand) and every few seconds glass, tinted glass, amethyst, or quarts will pop off of your back as the sand is converted by starwisp powers. Other players can place any kind of 'sand' taged item on you for this effect.

- Added compatibility with FutaraDragon race so that both FutaraDragon 'Ah' and DavwynDragon 'Murrp' attention sounds can cause the other dragon race to reply back.

- Added FutaraDragon's improvement to the Deep Sleep state in the Figura model so when sleeping your pose is much more consistent across player perspectives.

- Added several more mobs to the Friendly Starwisp whitelist (energyorb_nontarget.json) from multiple mods and vanilla.

- Slight texture change to figura model to make sparks and slashes match beam colours.
